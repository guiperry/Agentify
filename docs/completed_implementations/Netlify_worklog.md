# Netlify Migration Worklog

## Migration Status: Completed ✅
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Verified By**: Automated System Check  
**WebSocket Removal**: Confirmed  
**SSE Implementation**: Fully Operational (Receive Only)
**HTTP Implementation**: Fully Operational (Send Only)

## Implemented Components

### Core Functions
- [x] `auth.js` - Supabase authentication handler
- [x] `compile-stream.js` - SSE Go compilation stream (receive)
- [x] `compile.js` - HTTP Go compilation trigger (send)
- [x] `deploy-stream.js` - SSE Netlify deployment stream (receive)
- [x] `deploy.js` - HTTP Netlify deployment trigger (send)
- [x] `validate-identity.js` - Identity validation
- [x] `validate-api-keys.js` - API key validation

### Configuration
- [x] `netlify.toml` - Properly configured for functions
- [x] Supabase integration - Working with RLS policies
- [x] Environment variables - Configured for production

### Frontend Changes
- [x] WebSocket removal - Complete
- [x] SSE integration - Working in all components (receive only)
- [x] HTTP POST integration - Working for all message sending
- [x] Supabase auth - Implemented with protected routes

## Verification Tests

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User signup/login working
   - Protected routes enforce auth
   - Session management operational

2. **Compilation Process**
   - Go compilation streams logs via SSE
   - Success/failure states handled
   - Download links generated
   - HTTP triggers working

3. **Deployment Tracking**
   - Netlify API integration working
   - Progress updates via SSE
   - Final deployment URL provided
   - HTTP triggers working

4. **Validation Endpoints**
   - Identity validation operational
   - API key testing functional

## Outstanding Items

- `validate-personality.js` - Not implemented (consolidated into identity validation)
- `validate-capabilities.js` - Not implemented (consolidated into identity validation)

## Migration Notes

The WebSocket to SSE migration was completed according to the aggressive 24-hour timeline. All core functionality has been verified in production. The two missing validation functions were intentionally consolidated into the identity validation endpoint after determining they didn't need separate implementations.

Final verification confirms:
- ✅ Zero WebSocket code remains (verified via full codebase search)
- ✅ All WebSocket server files deleted
- ✅ All WebSocket client references removed
- ✅ All real-time functionality works via SSE (receive)
- ✅ All message sending works via HTTP POST
- ✅ TypeScript types updated to match new architecture
- Authentication is fully implemented
- Compilation and deployment processes are stable
