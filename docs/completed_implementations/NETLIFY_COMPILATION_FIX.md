# Netlify Compilation Fix Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of fixes for compilation issues in the Netlify serverless environment.

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing two main issues on Netlify:

1. **Missing SSE Stream Function**: Frontend was trying to connect to `/.netlify/functions/stream` but the function didn't exist
2. **Go Compiler Unavailable**: Local Go compilation fails in Netlify's serverless environment with error "spawn go ENOENT"

## Solution Overview

We implemented a two-pronged approach:

### 1. Fixed SSE Stream Function
- Created `netlify/functions/stream.js` to handle SSE connections
- Supports both GET (SSE stream) and POST (compilation triggers) requests
- Provides proper CORS headers and authentication

### 2. GitHub Actions Fallback Compilation
- Created a GitHub Actions workflow for plugin compilation when local compilation fails
- Automatic fallback system that tries local compilation first, then GitHub Actions
- Real-time status updates via SSE during the compilation process

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

1. **`netlify/functions/stream.js`**
   - Main SSE endpoint that frontend connects to
   - Handles authentication and CORS
   - Supports compilation request queuing

2. **`src/lib/github-actions-compiler.ts`**
   - GitHub Actions integration service
   - Workflow triggering and status monitoring
   - Artifact download management

3. **`.github/workflows/compile-plugin.yml`**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for plugin compilation
   - Supports both WASM and Go plugin compilation
   - Automatic artifact upload with 7-day retention

4. **`src/app/api/compile/status/route.ts`**
   - API endpoint for checking GitHub Actions compilation status
   - Supports both polling and waiting for completion

5. **`docs/supabase-schema.sql`**
   - Database schema for tracking compilation requests
   - Tables for agent configs and compiled plugins
   - Row-level security policies

6. **`docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`**
   - Comprehensive setup guide for GitHub Actions
   - Troubleshooting and monitoring instructions

7. **`scripts/test-github-actions.js`**
   - Test script to verify GitHub Actions setup
   - Environment variable validation

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/app/api/compile/route.ts`**
   - Added GitHub Actions fallback logic
   - Improved error handling and SSE updates
   - Automatic method selection (local → GitHub Actions)

2. **`package.json`**
   - Added `@octokit/rest` dependency
   - Added test script for GitHub Actions

3. **`netlify.toml`**
   - Added GitHub Actions environment variable placeholders
   - Maintained existing SSE configuration

## Implementation Details

### Compilation Flow

```
1. User clicks "Process Configuration"
2. Frontend sends request to /api/compile
3. Server tries local Go compilation
4. If local fails → Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
5. Monitor workflow status via GitHub API
6. Download compiled artifacts when ready
7. Return download URL to frontend
```

### SSE Communication

```
Frontend ←→ /.netlify/functions/stream
- Connection establishment
- Real-time compilation updates
- Status notifications
- Error reporting
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```
1. Receive workflow_dispatch with agent config
2. Setup Go 1.21 + Python 3.11 + build tools
3. Generate Go and Python code from templates
4. Compile to WASM or Go plugin format
5. Package with Python service and config
6. Upload as downloadable artifact
```

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to Netlify environment variables:

```bash
# GitHub Actions (required for fallback compilation)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_OWNER=guiperry
GITHUB_REPO=next-agentify
GITHUB_WORKFLOW_ID=compile-plugin.yml

# Supabase (existing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
npm run test-github-actions
```

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to Netlify with environment variables
2. Test compilation through web interface
3. Monitor GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution
4. Check Netlify function logs for fallback behavior

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Automatic fallback ensures compilation always works
2. **Performance**: Local compilation when possible, cloud when needed
3. **Scalability**: GitHub Actions handles heavy compilation workloads
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time updates and comprehensive logging
5. **Cost-Effective**: Uses free GitHub Actions minutes

## Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:
- Local compilation failures
- GitHub Actions unavailability
- Network timeouts
- Authentication errors
- Workflow execution failures

## Security

- GitHub token with minimal required permissions
- User authentication required for all requests
- Row-level security in Supabase
- Automatic artifact cleanup after 7 days

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy to Netlify and test the complete flow
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track GitHub Actions minutes usage
3. **Optimize**: Cache compilation results for identical configurations
4. **Scale**: Add additional fallback providers if needed

## Troubleshooting

If compilation still fails:

1. Check Netlify function logs for error details
2. Verify GitHub token permissions and environment variables
3. Review GitHub Actions workflow runs for build errors
4. Test SSE connection in browser developer tools
5. Validate Supabase schema and permissions

This implementation provides a robust, scalable solution for plugin compilation in serverless environments while maintaining the existing user experience.
