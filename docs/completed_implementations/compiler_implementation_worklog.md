# Compiler Implementation Worklog

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing the AI Agent Plugin Compiler as detailed in the compiler_implementation_plan.md file. The implementation follows the phased approach outlined in the original plan.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### Day 1: Project Setup and Initial Implementation

- [x] Created project directory structure for the compiler
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration for the compiler
- [x] Implemented the core AgentPluginConfig interface
- [x] Implemented the ToolConfig, ResourceConfig, and PromptConfig interfaces
- [x] Created the basic AgentCompiler class structure
- [x] Implemented the createBuildDirectory method
- [x] Implemented the generateGoCode method
- [x] Implemented the processTemplate and processToolTemplate methods
- [x] Implemented the embedResources method
- [x] Implemented the processResourcesTemplate method
- [x] Implemented the generatePythonService method
- [x] Implemented the processPythonTemplate method
- [x] Implemented the compileGoPlugin method
- [x] Implemented the cleanup method

### Day 2: Template Creation and UI Integration

- [x] Created main.go.template for the main Go plugin file
- [x] Created tool.go.template for tool implementations
- [x] Created resources.go.template for resource embedding
- [x] Created go.mod.template for Go module configuration
- [x] Created agent_service.py.template for Python agent service
- [x] Created tee.go.template for Trusted Execution Environment
- [x] Created agent-compiler-interface.ts for UI integration
- [x] Implemented CompilerPanel component for the UI
- [x] Integrated CompilerPanel into DeploymentPanel

## Next Steps

- Implement the agent-compiler.ts unit tests
- Implement the agent-compiler-interface.ts unit tests
- Create a CLI interface for the compiler
- Implement the AgentFacts integration
- Implement the KNIRV integration
- Implement the memory management system
- Implement the TEE framework
