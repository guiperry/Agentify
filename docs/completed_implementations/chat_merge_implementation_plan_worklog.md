# Chat Merge Implementation Worklog

This document tracks the progress of implementing the chat functionality from MY-CHAT-BRAIN_v2 into the main Agentify application as outlined in the [Chat Merge Implementation Plan](./chat_merge_implementation_plan.md).

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation ✅

- [x] Create database tables for chat sessions and messages
- [x] Implement the ChatContext provider with deployment step awareness
- [x] Create API routes for chat functionality
- [x] Set up Gemini API integration with contextual prompting

### Phase 2: Component Implementation ✅

- [x] Enhance the ChatInterface component with real AI integration and deployment step awareness
- [x] Create the ChatSessionDrawer component for history management
- [x] Update the ChatModal component to use the ChatProvider and pass the current deployment step
- [x] Modify the AgentDeployer component to track and pass the current tab to the ChatModal

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement ✅

- [x] Test chat functionality with real AI responses
- [x] Test session persistence and history management
- [x] Verify that contextual responses match the current deployment step
- [x] Ensure UI consistency with the existing Agentify design
- [x] Test the Help feature for each deployment step
- [x] Optimize performance and fix any issues

### Phase 4: Deployment ✅

- [x] Prepare the application for deployment
- [x] Create setup documentation
- [x] Add environment configuration

## Implementation Details
